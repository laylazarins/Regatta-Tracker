# Sailing Regatta Tracker


An application to simplify recording sailing
race results, manage competitors, store sets of 
races (*known as "regattas"*), manage disqualifications,
automatically determine the overall
ranking of different teams within each race, and
automatically calculate a final ranking.
This application would be used by sailing clubs and
regatta organizers to easily and simply manage a 
regatta. As someone who used to sail competitively,
I was always frustrated as a competitor with how long
it would take to get regatta results at times, and
although there's always the issue of recording 
sailing times while out on the water, a simplified,
easy-to-use application to organize those results
would help to save time.
